After the early-month ramp-up (caused by data window boundaries rather than true traffic expansion), the trend line flattens, indicating that demand and operational capacity stayed steady despite regional weather disruptions earlier in the month.\nSecond, the raw daily counts reveal a strong weekly cycle. Flight activity dips sharply every 6–7 days—corresponding to weekend troughs, followed by a rebound at the start of the week and a peak approaching the mid-week business-travel window. This pattern mirrors the broader industry structure:\n\nHigher mid-week volumes driven by business travel\nLower weekend volumes, especially on Saturdays\nRepeated, predictable oscillations independent of weather events\n\n\nIn summary, despite intermittent day-to-day volatility, October 2024 maintained a stable overall flight volume with clear weekly demand cycles. This indicates strong underlying demand and a resilient operational baseline, even in a month affected by significant regional weather events."

Carrier and NAS-related cancellations accounted for only a very small percentage (approximately 2–4%), almost negligible in the overall trend.\nThis highly skewed distribution was not accidental, but strongly correlated with the extreme weather conditions in October 2024.\nThis month fell in the latter part of the Atlantic hurricane season and was directly impacted by Hurricane Milton, particularly in Florida and the southeastern coast. Simultaneously, October was recorded nationwide as an unusually warm and humid month, with more frequent extreme rainfall, thunderstorms, and tropical systems, significantly increasing the risks to flight operations.\nTherefore, the distribution of cancellation causes reveals a systemic signal dominated by weather:\n\nIn October 2024, extreme weather was the overwhelming primary cause of cancellations across the entire aviation system, rather than operational efficiency or air traffic control factors.\n\n\n\n4.2 Top Airports Most Affected by Weather Cancellations\n\n\nCode\ndf_top &lt;- df_cancel_reason |&gt;\n  filter(Reason == \"Weather\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(NumCancel)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 15)\n\nggplot(df_top,\n       aes(x = NumCancel, y = fct_reorder(Airport, NumCancel))) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = Airport), linewidth = 0.6) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"#e0645c\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top Airports by\\nWeather-Related Cancellations\",\n    x = \"Cancellations\", \n    y = \"Airport\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      hjust = 0,              \n      face  = \"bold\",\n      size  = 18,\n      margin = margin(b = 8)   \n    ),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    plot.margin = margin(t = 15, r = 30, b = 20, l = 40)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight:\nAirport-level analysis of weather-related cancellations reveals that:\nThe most severely affected airports are highly concentrated in Florida and the southeastern coastal region.

    "text": "Synthesis & Takeaways\nAcross all analyses, a coherent picture emerges of how airline operations behaved during October 2024. Despite being a month characterized by weather volatility and regionally concentrated disruptions, the U.S. air transportation system displayed both predictable structure and points of vulnerability.\nFirst, extreme behaviors in flight timing—whether very late or very early—were concentrated among the same set of regional carriers, such as PSA, SkyWest, and Envoy. This reflects a structural sensitivity in regional operations: tight turnaround schedules and small fleet buffers create larger swings in both delay and recovery, amplifying the extremes on both ends. In contrast, major carriers (Delta, United, JetBlue) showed far narrower ranges, demonstrating stronger operational stability.\nSecond, demand patterns were highly cyclical and predictable. Weekly flight volume followed a clear rhythm—peaking mid-week (especially Thursday) and bottoming out on Saturdays—highlighting the interplay between business travel cycles and leisure demand. Daily flight counts further confirmed this pattern: once the early-month ramp-up stabilized, volumes held consistently around 20,000 flights per day, with only mild weekday/weekend oscillations. This suggests that despite weather-driven disruptions, underlying demand remained robust and stable.\nThird, weather was the dominant systemic disruptor, driving more than 90% of all cancellations nationwide. The concentration of cancellations in Florida and coastal airports—especially Orlando, Tampa, and Sarasota—aligned closely with October’s extreme meteorological events, including the impacts of Hurricane Milton and a historically warm, storm-prone month across the southeastern U.S. The geography of cancellations underscores that disruption risk is not evenly distributed; rather, it clusters in regions exposed to tropical systems, thunderstorms, and seasonal atmospheric instability.\nTaken together, these findings reveal a multi-layered picture of the October 2024 aviation environment:\n\nAirline-specific operational resilience varies widely, with regional carriers exhibiting the greatest volatility.\nDemand-driven cycles remain stable even under disruptive conditions, enabling predictable scheduling patterns.\nWeather is the single largest systemic threat, capable of overwhelming both operational planning and airspace capacity when extreme events occur.\nDisruptions are highly regional, emphasizing the need for localized mitigation strategies rather than one-size-fits-all policies."
